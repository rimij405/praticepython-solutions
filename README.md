## About This Repository ##

Currently this repository is a way for me to track my own exercises and solutions. There is no front-end; it's just a set of python exercises that are publicly available to review. Each challenge will be accompanied by a solution that I have created as well as the solution accepted by Pratusevich on the original website, if one is available.

[You can view the table of contents here](https://github.com/rimij405/praticepython-solutions/blob/master/exercises/table-of-contents.md).

### Roadmap ###

- [ ] Complete solutions for exercises.
- [ ] Create an accompanying website to browse the solutions for each of the exercises.

### Installation ###

Currently, you will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) installed on your local system - the exercises were created with Python 3 in mind.

Clone the repository from your command line with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rimij405/praticepython-solutions.git <target-directory-name>
```
